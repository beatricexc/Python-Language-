        "The designer of Python advocated an approach to writing code that was never actually written down. Eventually, style guides and best practices were formalised and written down. Such guides were ultimately incorporated as into Python as the de-facto and recommended approach to Python programming. This was done via a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) - a mechanism via which engineers could recommend language improvements. PEP8 included a set of coding style standards. There now exists automated tools that you can use to cheek that your code adheres to such standards. Below is a link to one such tool. I recommend getting into the habit of following the [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n",
